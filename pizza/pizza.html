	<h3> Ingredients: </h3>

	<ul>
		<li>2 cups Flour, AP</li>
		<li>1 tbsp Yeast, instant</li>
		<li>1 cup Water, warm</li>
		<li>2 tsp Sugar</li>
		<li>pinch Salt</li>
		<li>5 tbsp EV Olive Oil (1/2 tbsp in dough)</li>
		<li>1 cup Tomato Sauce</li>
		<li>Optional Amount - Cheese</li>
		<li>Any toppings you want</li>
	</ul>

	<p><em>When you use instant yeast it does not have to be added to warm water before you use it in the recipe. However, active and fresh yeast should be added to warm water before use. Active yeast is an inferior product and I would avoid using it, try to use fresh or instant. Add warm to hot water to your flour: it will relax the gluten and bring the temperature of your dough closer to 27 or 28 degrees Celsius, the temperature you want it to proof at.</em></p>

	<p><em>I did cheese for my kids and pancetta, onion, and olives for myself. I like to have Parmigiano-Reggiano and some chilli flakes to sprinkle on at the end. Feel free you add whatever you want.</em></p>

	<h3> Procedure: </h3>

	<p>Start by preheating your oven to 550 F or as high as your oven goes. Turn on the convection fan if you have one available. Add the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil, and water (warm-hot) and mix quickly.</p>

	</div>

	<p>You can use a spoon to quickly bring it together in the bowl. It should be pretty wet still. If it is too dry then add a bit more water.</p>

	<div class="center">

	</div>

	<p>If the dough is wet and soft, then you can just stretch it and fold it. Otherwise, you can kneed it like I do in the following video. Use the flour around you to adjust how wet the dough is while kneading. If you have a mixer: mix (the straight dough method) on second speed for 8-10 minutes. When the dough has been kneaded enough use a window test: stretch the dough between your fingers. If the dough rips, keep on mixing or kneading it until it stretches. It should stretch enough that you can see through it. See this article for more help:</p>

	<P>If you do not have a lid, wrap it or put a towel over it. Just keep it warm. The dough should at least double in size before you use it.</P>

	<p>Rub some oil on the bottom of the pan. If you want: you can add some cornmeal and sugar to the oil before you roll out your dough, I did not.</p>

	<h2>Artisanal Option: Preferment</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>1 cup Flour</li>
		<li>1 cup Water</li>
		<li>1 tsp Yeast</li>
	</ul>

	<p>*Artisan Breads: if you want to make the dough more flavourful. Make a preferment the day before and let it sit out until it looks like this. You can see that it is just ready, because the small folds on the top. That means the preferment is at it's peak (just before it falls back down). If you can not make the pizza right at this point, try to get it in the fridge before it falls.</p>



	<div class="center">
		<img src="images/preferm.jpg" style="width:100%; height: 100%;">
	</div>

	<p>You will have to add more flour if you make this preferment at the time you add it to the dough, as the preferment if 50% more wet than the dough.</p><p><strong>Good Luck!</strong></p>
